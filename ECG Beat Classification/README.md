# ECG Beat Classification

This folder contains various experiments corresponding to the ECG Beat Classification using HeartNetEC model (as mentioned in the paper).

The following is a list of files present in this folder, with a brief description :

- **ECG_BeatClassification_RawData.ipynb** - A python notebook consisting of experiments corresponding to training and evaluation of ECG Beat Classification using raw data (without denoising)
on Physionet's MIT BIH Arrhythmia Database. Note that this a Google Colab Notebook.

- **ECG_BeatClassification_DenoisedData.ipynb** - A python notebook consisting of experiments corresponding to training and evaluation of ECG Beat Classification using denoised data (raw data from Physionet's MIT BIH Arrhythmia Database passed through the denoising block).
